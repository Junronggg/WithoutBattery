# ⚡ WithoutBattery

**WithoutBattery** is a playful, AI-powered productivity and learning tool designed to help students:
- ask **better questions**
- stay **focused while working**
- and build **healthy study habits** — the fun (and slightly chaotic) way.

Think of it as an educational assistant that *refuses to tolerate bad questions and procrastination*.

---

## 🎯 Why WithoutBattery?

Students today have access to powerful AI tools — but:
- they often ask **vague or poorly-structured questions**
- they get distracted easily
- they rely on motivation instead of discipline

**WithoutBattery solves this by combining AI guidance, focus detection, and gamified pressure.**

No motivation?  
No problem.  
We don’t need batteries.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Ask-Correct-Question AI (Prompt Coach)

- Connected to the **OpenAI API**
- When a student asks a question:
  - ✅ **Good question** (specific, targeted) → AI answers normally
  - ❌ **Bad question** (vague, lazy, unclear) →  
    AI **refuses to answer directly** and instead:
    - explains *why* the question is weak
    - guides the user to improve it
    - teaches prompt engineering implicitly

🎓 **Educational goal:**  
Help students learn *how to think and ask*, not just copy answers.

### 2️⃣ Focus Detection & Study Timer

WithoutBattery detects whether the user is actually working:

- ⏱️ Tracks **active working time**
- 🏆 Displays a **leaderboard** to encourage consistency
- 👀 **Eye closed** →  
  - alert sound plays  
  - photo is taken as a warning
- 😮 **Mouth open** →  
  - interpreted as “awake & active”
  - study timer resumes

🎯 **Goal:** Encourage alertness and active engagement, not passive screen time.

---

### 3️⃣ 😈 Crazy Mode (Annoying Mode)

An optional mode for users who *really* need discipline.

When enabled:
- Typing becomes intentionally difficult
- Random annoying sounds play
- UI becomes chaotic
- Chat still works, but patience is tested

To exit:
- Press `ESC` **5 times**

💡 **Design philosophy:**  
If procrastination is uncomfortable, focus becomes the easier choice.
